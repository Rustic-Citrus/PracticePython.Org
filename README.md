This repository contains my solutions to the Python exercises posted by Michele Pratusevich at [https://www.practicepython.org/]().

If you wish to try the exercises for yourself, I recommend that you don't look at my work until after you've had a go.

For more information about the exercises or to read the exercise prompts, please visit Michele's website.
